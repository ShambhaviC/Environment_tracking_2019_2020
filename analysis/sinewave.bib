	abstract = {The brms package implements Bayesian multilevel models in R using the probabilistic programming language Stan. A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to ﬁt – among others – linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, response times, ordinal, quantile, zero-inﬂated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user deﬁned covariance structures, censored data, as well as metaanalytic standard errors. Prior speciﬁcations are ﬂexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reﬂect their beliefs. In addition, model ﬁt can easily be assessed and compared using posterior-predictive checks and leave-one-out crossvalidation.

	abstract = {Several characteristics of flowers and fruits have been suggested as comprising syndromes of characters that indicate particular classes of pollinators and fruit dispersers. Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal-Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinatorl disperser classes. Mann-Whitney U-tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose-rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran fruits were sucrose-rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plant-animal interactions be anticipated.},

	abstract = {Recently, it was argued that extrinsic factors, such as high foraging costs, lead to elevated field metabolic rates (FMR). We tested this suggestion by comparing the FMR of nectar-feeding and fruit-eating bats. We hypothesized that the foraging effort per energy reward is higher for nectar-feeding mammals than for fruit-eating mammals, since energy rewards at flowering plants are smaller than those at fruiting plants. Using the doubly labelled water method, we measured the FMR of nectar-feeding Glossophaga commissarisi and fruit-eating Carollia brevicauda, which coexisted in the same rainforest habitat and shared the same daytime roosts. Mass-specific FMR of G. commissarisi exceeded that of C. brevicauda by a factor of almost two: 5.3±0.6 kJ g−1 day−1 for G. commissarisi and 2.8±0.4 kJ g−1 day−1 for C. brevicauda. Since nectar-feeding bats imbibe nectar droplets of only 193 J energy content during each flower visit, a G. commissarisi bat has to perform several 100 flower visits per night to meet its energy requirement. The fruit-eating C. brevicauda, on the other hand, needs to harvest only 3–12 Piper infructescenses per night, as the energy reward per Piper equals ca. 6–30 kJ. We argue that the flowering and fruiting plants exert different selective forces on the foraging behaviour and energetics of pollinators and the seed dispersers, respectively. A comparison between nectar-feeding and non-nectar-feeding species in various vertebrate taxa demonstrates that pollinators have elevated FMRs.},

	abstract = {High blood glucose levels caused by excessive sugar consumption are detrimental to mammalian health and life expectancy. Despite consuming vast quantities of sugar-rich floral nectar, nectar-feeding bats are long-lived, provoking the question of how they regulate blood glucose. We investigated blood glucose levels in nectar-feeding bats (
              Glossophaga soricina
              ) in experiments in which we varied the amount of dietary sugar or flight time. Blood glucose levels increased with the quantity of glucose ingested and exceeded 25 mmol l

              blood in resting bats, which is among the highest values ever recorded in mammals fed sugar quantities similar to their natural diet. During normal feeding, blood glucose values decreased with increasing flight time, but only fell to expected values when bats spent 75 per cent of their time airborne. Either nectar-feeding bats have evolved mechanisms to avoid negative health effects of hyperglycaemia, or high activity is key to balancing blood glucose levels during foraging. We suggest that the coevolutionary specialization of bats towards a nectar diet was supported by the high activity and elevated metabolic rates of these bats. High activity may have conferred benefits to the bats in terms of behavioural interactions and foraging success, and is simultaneously likely to have increased their efficiency as plant pollinators.},

	abstract = {The relationship between foraging behavior and resource availability for the long—nosed bat (Glossophaga soricina) and five species of plants it fed on in northern Columbia was investigated in a 10—mo study. Glossophaga employed two foraging tactics: (1) territorial defense of concentrated food sources, and (2) trapline foraging along regularly used feeding routes. The tactic used depended on availability of Agave desmettiana nectar and the individual bat's ability to dominate conspecifics. When both hunger and nectar levels were highest, bats concentrated their feeding activity on A. desmettiana. Aggressive behavior was displayed by dominant male and female bats during the first 3—5 h of feeding. Territorial behavior ceased suddenly when nectar levels were depleted by 50\% or more at 2.5—5 h after sunset. Later in the evening, bats foraged briefly from one plant to another at several species along regularly used routes. Bats that maintained early—evening territories had increased access to nectar—rich agave flowers and had significantly smaller total foraging areas than nonterritorial bats. The feeding territories of female Glossophaga were shared with their immature offspring. Territorial behavior at agave was attributed in part to defensibility of its flowers. Foraging experiments demonstrated that G. soricina used a feeding strategy that was efficient with respect to choice of food patch and allocation of time. This is the first study that used marked individuals to document feeding territories and trapline foraging for nectar—feeding bats.},

	abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.

The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.

The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.

	abstract = {Foraging in a variable environment presents a classic problem of decision making with incomplete information. Animals must track the changing environment, remember the best options and make choices accordingly. While several experimental studies have explored the idea that sampling behavior reflects the amount of environmental change, we take the next logical step in asking how change influences memory. We explore the hypothesis that memory length should be tied to the ecological relevance and the value of the information learned, and that environmental change is a key determinant of the value of memory. We use a dynamic programming model to confirm our predictions and then test memory length in a factorial experiment. In our experimental situation we manipulate rates of change in a simple foraging task for blue jays over a 36 hour period. After jays experienced an experimentally determined change regime, we tested them at a range of retention intervals, from 1 to 72 hours. Manipulated rates of change influenced learning and sampling rates: subjects sampled more and learned more quickly in the high change condition. Tests of retention revealed significant interactions between retention interval and the experienced rate of change. We observed a striking and surprising difference between the high and low change treatments at the 24 hour retention interval. In agreement with earlier work we find that a circadian retention interval is special, but we find that the extent of this ‘specialness’ depends on the subject’s prior experience of environmental change. Specifically, experienced rates of change seem to influence how subjects balance recent information against past experience in a way that interacts with the passage of time.},

The alternative foraging site is stable and offers an intermediate probability of reward. The model was tested with pigeons in a shuttle-box the two ends of which represented the two foraging sites. The pigeons succeeded in tracking the changes in the fluctuating site and the payoff attained was close to the optimum. Variations in the frequency of sampling between experimental treatments were in qualitative agreement with the model for some treatments but not others. The quantitative details of sampling behaviour were not as predicted by the optimality model, but many features could be accounted for by a mechanistic model of choice. The pigeons' choice rule, although different from that of the optimality model, is one that produces near-optimal payoffs under the conditions of this experiment.},

The birds were presented with two feeders, one constant and one varying. The varying feeder switched between a good and a bad state; how soon a bird maximizing its net rate of energy intake should visit the varying feeder after finding it bad depended both on the probability of the varying feeder switching and on the value of its two states relative to the constant feeder. The experiment yielded limited qualitative support for the tracking model, but the quantitative predictions failed. As predicted, the hummingbirds sampled with low frequency when the probability of switch was low, and sampled more frequently ffhen the probability of switch was higher. However, none of four birds avoided the varying feeder when low mean amount and low predictability made it so unprofitable relative to the constant alternative that a rate maximizer should not have visited it at all.},

In this study, we determined the psychometric function for nectar volume discrimination of a Neotropical ﬂower-visiting bat Glossophaga soricina. For this, we examined the ability of bats to discriminate between two nectar volumes in a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. We used a Bayesian inference approach to determine psychometric functions. From the derived psychometric function we assessed the discrimination threshold at a value of 0.69. G. soricina could clearly distinguish between two volumes, when the difference between the two nectar volumes divided by their average exceeded this value. This indicates that bats possess a sense for the perception and discrimination of volumes of nectar that is better developed than in honeybees.},

	abstract = {Weber’s law quantifies the perception of difference between stimuli. For instance, it can explain why we are less likely to detect the removal of three nuts from a bowl if the bowl is full than if it is nearly empty. This is an example of the magnitude effect – the phenomenon that the subjective perception of a linear difference between a pair of stimuli progressively diminishes when the average magnitude of the stimuli increases. Although discrimination performances of both human and animal subjects in various sensory modalities exhibit the magnitude effect, results sometimes systematically deviate from the quantitative predictions based on Weber’s law. An attempt to reformulate the law to better fit data from acoustic discrimination tasks has been dubbed the ‘‘near-miss to Weber’s law’’. Here, we tested the gustatory discrimination performance of nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina), in order to investigate whether the original version of Weber’s law accurately predicts choice behavior in a two-alternative forced choice task. As expected, bats either preferred the sweeter of the two options or showed no preference. In 4 out of 6 bats the near-miss to Weber’s law provided a better fit and Weber’s law underestimated the magnitude effect. In order to test the generality of this observation in nectar-feeders, we reviewed previously published data on bats, hummingbirds, honeybees, and bumblebees. In all groups of animals the near-miss to Weber’s law provided better fits than Weber’s law. Furthermore, whereas the magnitude effect was stronger than predicted by Weber’s law in vertebrates, it was weaker than predicted in insects. Thus nectar-feeding vertebrates and insects seem to differ in how their choice behavior changes as sugar concentration is increased. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of the observed patterns of sugar concentration discrimination.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Cryptic species, defined as those that are morphologically indistinguishable but phylogenetically distinct, are common in bats and correspond to the majority of newly described species. Such seems to be the case of Glossophaga soricina, a generalist, glossophagine bat that is broadly distributed throughout the Neotropics. Several studies have found high levels of molecular variation within G. soricina, suggesting that it could be a cryptic species complex. Here, we explore data derived from two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of cranial characters and their covariation with environmental variables, aiming to test the existence of more than one species grouped within it and to contribute to the knowledge of its variation and evolutionary history. Variation in shape and size of skull and mandible supports the two main mitochondrial lineages reported in previous studies, one corresponding to the east side of the Andes (subspecies G. s. soricina) and the other one corresponding to populations from Mesoamerica and the west side of the Andes, in turn composed of at least three monophyletic and morphologically differentiated taxa. Environmental variables correlate with shape variation and might be responsible for convergences in shape and size between the species with the smallest distributions. Based on the evidence we present in this work we elevate four subspecies to the taxonomic level of species. The correct names for the species of the analyzed complex are: G. soricina (Pallas 1766), G. mutica Merriam 1898, G. antillarum Rehn 1902, and G. valens Miller 1913.},

Theory suggests that the value of collecting information, or sampling, depends on environmental persistence and on the relative costs of making wrong decisions. However, empirical tests of how these variables interact are lacking. We tested whether bumblebee foraging decisions are indeed influenced by these two factors. We gave bees repeated choices between a resource providing a steady, mediocre reward and a resource fluctuating between a low reward and a high reward. In this paradigm, we manipulated environmental persistence by changing how long the quality of a fluctuating resource remained stable at one reward level. We manipulated the costs of decision errors by changing the relative values of the available rewards. Bees sampled the fluctuating resource more frequently when it changed quality more frequently, indicating that they measured environmental persistence and reacted to it as predicted by theory. Bees showed surprisingly suboptimal tracking, not reliably choosing the currently best resource except when the fluctuating resource was very persistent and the potential rewards high. While bees modify their choices in response to different levels of change and potential rewards, they do not always do so according to optimality predictions.},

Here, we take the view that “choice behaviour” is a product of agent, environment, and observer, and that “mechanisms of choice” are therefore not to be located solely within the chooser. A simple model, employing the novel methodology of evolving choice behaviour in a multi-agent system, is used to demonstrate that matching behaviour can occur (in stable environments) without any dedicated choice mechanism.},

The model predicts signal following when signal reliability exceeds environmental certainty. We tested this model experimentally using captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. During each trial, the jays had to choose between two stimuli; one option was correct and led to food, and the other was incorrect and provided no reward. In addition, a third stimulus, the signal, provided information about which choice stimulus was correct. Using this procedure, we manipulated signal reliability (the probability that the signal matched the correct stimulus) and environmental uncertainty (the background probability that a given stimulus was correct) in a factorial experiment. Signal reliability and environmental uncertainty influenced signal use roughly as predicted. Jays used the signal when the signal was reliable and the environment was uncertain, and they ignored the signal when it was unreliable and the environment was predictable. Quantitatively, we observed a bias in favour of environment tracking. Jays sometimes ignored the signal when it could have helped them, and they ignored the signal in conditions where signal following and environment tracking produced equal payoffs.

Although one can cast the problem of patch exploitation as a binary choice, naturally occurring patch-leaving decisions are inevitably asymmetric. We asked whether captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, treat leaving and staying in the same way. To do this we factorially varied the delays associated with leaving and staying in a food patch. In addition, we manipulated our subject’s level of motivation (e.g. hunger) using prefeeding treatments. We found that hungry subjects came closest to our prediction of treating leaving and staying in the same way, but that less motivated subjects showed a pronounced and surprising bias in favour of leaving. We discuss the implications of results for experimental and theoretical studies and choice behaviour. We suggest that students of choice behaviour need to understand the sources of such biases because naturally occurring choice situations are seldom perfectly symmetrical.},

	abstract = {In this article a series of agent-based models support the hypothesis that behaviors adapted to a group situation may be suboptimal (or “irrational”) when expressed by an isolated individual. These models focus on two areas of current concern in behavioral ecology and experimental psychology: the “interference function” (which relates the intake rate of a focal forager to the density of conspecifics) and the “matching law” (which formalizes the observation that many animals match the frequency of their response to different stimuli in proportion to the reward obtained from each stimulus type). Each model employs genetic algorithms to evolve foraging behaviors for multiple agents in spatially explicit environments, structured at the level of situated perception and action. A second concern of this article is to extend the understanding of both matching and interference per se by modeling at this level.},

Adaptive behaviour relies upon accurate estimation of relevant ecological parameters; the better informed an individual, the better it can develop and adjust its behaviour to meet the demands of a variable world. Here, we focus on the burgeoning interest in the impact of ecological uncertainty on adaptation, and the means by which it can be reduced by gathering information, from both ‘passive’ and ‘responsive’ sources. Our overview demonstrates the value of adopting an explicitly informational approach, and highlights the components that one needs to develop useful approaches to studying information use by animals. We propose a quantitative framework, based on statistical decision theory, for analysing animal information use in evolutionary ecology. Our purpose is to promote an integrative approach to studying information use by animals, which is itself integral to adaptive animal behaviour and organismal biology.},

	abstract = {Observations that humans and other species are sensitive to variability in the outcome of their choices has led to the widespread assumption that this sensitivity reflects adaptations to cope with risk (stochasticity of action consequences). We question this assumption in experiments with starlings. We show that choices between outcomes that are risky in both amount and delay to food are predictable from preferences in the absence of risk. We find that the overarching best predictor of an option's value is the average of the ratios of amount to delay across its (frequency weighted) outcomes, an expression known as “Expectation of the Ratios”, or EoR. Most tests of risk sensitivity focus on the predicted impact of energetic state on preference for risk. We show instead that under controlled state conditions subjects are variance- and risk-neutral with respect to EoR, and this implies variance neutrality for amounts and variance-proneness for delays. The weak risk aversion for amounts often reported requires a small modification of EoR. EoR is consistent with associative learning: acquisition of value for initially neutral stimuli is roughly proportional to the magnitude of their consequences and inversely proportional to the interval between the stimulus and its consequence's onset. If, as is likely, the effect of amount on acquisition is sublinear, the result is a deviation from EoR towards risk aversion for amount. In 3 experiments, we first establish individual birds’ preferences between pairs of fixed options that differ in both amount and delay (small-sooner vs. large-later), and then examine choices between stochastic mixtures that include these options. Experiment 1 uses a titration to establish certainty equivalents, while experiments 2 and 3 measure degree of preference between options with static parameters. The mixtures differ in the coefficient of variation of amount, delay, or both, but EoR is sufficient to predict all results, with no additional explanatory role for riskiness.},

	abstract = {A paper by Caraco, Martindale and Whittam (1980, Animal Behaviour, 28, 820–830) transformed foraging behaviour research by the fundamental realization that actions in nature only rarely have precisely predictable outcomes. They showed that the consequences of risk, understood as the unpredictability and variance of consequences, must play a central role in functional and mechanistic analysis of animal decision processes. Here we examine the article's theoretical and experimental contribution with the benefit of over three decades of hindsight, review developments in the intervening time and discuss the future. Our review confirms previous ones showing that although the earliest results supported the predictions of the original models, a full analysis of the literature does not. In spite of a likely positive publication bias, the majority of studies fail to support a shift from risk proneness when in negative energetic budget to risk aversion when in positive budget, as embodied in the budget rule, and the proportion of failures increases with time. Furthermore, re-examining the earlier experiments we conclude that support should not have been expected, mostly because they implausibly assumed that all probabilities were known to the subjects. We argue that such assumptions should be abandoned, being replaced by realistic, evidence-based models of learning and information processing, such as associative learning and Weber's Law. Our overall message is that models are research tools that can be fecund even if they are transformed and even refuted with the passage of time and the associated accumulation of knowledge.},

	abstract = {Orientation depends on multi-modal information about the locally perceptible environment (local view) in many situations. We developed a behavioural paradigm for investigating visual orientation of flying bats based on a large-scale touch screen (1.2m × 1.8m). It functions by a grid of rows and columns of infra-red beams just in front of a screen with back-projected visual stimuli. Approaching animals interrupt the beams and thus permit automatic recording of the time and place of an animal’s locational choice. We used it as a vertical touch surface. Installed as a horizontal walk surface, it may also serve as a more natural ‘firm ground’, circular arena analogue to the ‘Morris water maze’ for investigating orientation behaviour and spatial cognition from rodents to birds while offering automatic real-time recording of paths, times and latencies with enhanced possibilities to score details of motor behaviour and to control stimuli interactively. Bats offer a unique possibility to investigate the use of both echo-acoustic and visual information processing pathways for the process of self-localization and orientation. In our first experiment, a bat was presented with five identical targets, one central and four peripheral and had to choose the central target. After task acquisition, the array was shifted by the distance between targets, so that a formerly peripheral landmark was now in the absolute location of the formerly central target. At small inter-target distances, the bat ‘went with’ the array, and chose the new central target (at a new absolute location). With 30cm or more of inter-target distance (60cm across the landmark configuration), however, the bat went with absolute location, and chose a peripheral target. In experiment 2, the bat was presented with two landmarks 30cm apart and an unmarked target located at midline beneath them. On tests, the landmarks either maintained training distance or were expanded to 50cm apart. On such expansion tests, the bat chose most the location at the correct vector from the right landmark. This showed that the bat first identified a single landmark by the configuration and then applied a previously learnt vector (angle and distance) to locate the target. Glossophaga did not orient by pure angular geometry between landmarks and target.},

Consequently, statistical physics was mostly seen as a toolbox rather than as a conceptual framework that could contribute to theory on evolutionary biology and ecology. However, the existence of mechanistic relationships and feedbacks between behavioral processes and statistical patterns of movement suggests that, beyond movement quantiﬁcation, statistical physics may prove to be an adequate framework to understand animal behavior across scales from an ecological and evolutionary perspective. Recently developed random search theory has served to critically re-evaluate classic ecological questions on animal foraging. For instance, during the last few years, there has been a growing debate on whether search behavior can include traits that improve success by optimizing random (stochastic) searches. Here, we stress the need to bring together the general encounter problem within foraging theory, as a mean for making progress in the biological understanding of random searching. By sketching the assumptions of optimal foraging theory (OFT) and by summarizing recent results on random search strategies, we pinpoint ways to extend classic OFT, and integrate the study of search strategies and its main results into the more general theory of optimal foraging.},

The argument is partly obscured by the semantic difficulties associated with the use of the term “theory” and its difference from “model” and “hypothesis.” Behavioral ecologists must be concerned with this debate because it is important to establish the relationship between theoretical statements and empirical evidence and to be aware of what is being tested when biological data are compared with theoretical predictions. It is also important to determine the relative advantages of alternative research programs. Differences in outlook between authors belonging to various schools of behavioral research are common. While one occasionally reads statements such as “optimality theory predicts (or fails to predict) the observed results,” thus implying that it is the theory itself that is under experimental test (Mazur 1981; Diamond 1984; Fantino \& Abarca 1985; Mellgren \& Brown in press; Rashotte in press), evolutionary zoologists interested in behavior usually maintain that optimality itself is not being tested, but rather that specific models derived from the theory are (Maynard Smith 1978; Curio 1983; Kacelnik 1984; Cheverton, Kacelnik \& Krebs 1985; Schmid-Hempel, Kacelnik \& Houston 1985).},

By discussing the meaningfulness of the model parameters, we come to the conclusion that the near-miss-to-Weber’s law can be applied to physical quantities which are measured on a ratio-, interval-, or log-interval scale, whereas applications of Weber’s law and Guilford’s power law are necessarily restricted to physical ratio scales. Finally, we discuss the meaningfulness of an empirically based submodel of the near-miss-to-Weber’s law, referred to as fixed-point model.

	abstract = {Foraging animals typically encounter opportunities that they either pursue or skip, but occasionally meet several alternatives simultaneously. Behavioural ecologists predict preferences using absolute properties of each option, while decision theorists focus on relative evaluations at the time of choice. We use European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to integrate ecological reasoning with decision models, linking and testing hypotheses for value acquisition and choice mechanism. We hypothesise that options’ values depend jointly on absolute attributes, learning context, and subject’s state. In simultaneous choices, preference could result either from comparing subjective values using deliberation time, or from processing each alternative independently, without relative comparisons. The combination of the value acquisition hypothesis and independent processing at choice time has been called the Sequential Choice Model. We test this model with options equated in absolute properties to exclude the possibility of preference being built at the time of choice. Starlings learned to obtain food by responding to four stimuli in two contexts. In context [AB], they encountered options A5 or B10 in random alternation; in context [CD], they met C10 or D20. Delay to food is denoted, in seconds, by the suffixes. Observed latency to respond (Li) to each option alone (our measure of value) ranked thus: LA{\textless}LC,LB,,LD, consistently with value being sensitive to both delay and learning context. We then introduced simultaneous presentations of A5 vs. C10 and B10 vs. C10, using latencies in no-choice tests to predict sign and strength of preference in pairings. Starlings preferred A5 over C10 and C10 over B10. There was no detectable evaluation time, and preference magnitude was predictable from latency differentials. This implies that value reflects learning rather than choice context, that preferences are not constructed by relative judgements at the time of choice, and that mechanisms adapted for sequential decisions are effective to predict choice behaviour.},

Finally, interventions for problem behavior were evaluated and differential reinforcement of alternative behavior and extinction procedures were implemented to increase appropriate behavior and decrease problem behavior.

	shorttitle = {Foraging},
	abstract = {Foraging is fundamental to animal survival and reproduction, yet it is much more than a simple matter of finding food; it is a biological imperative. Animals must find and consume resources to succeed, and they make extraordinary efforts to do so. For instance, pythons rarely eat, but when they do, their meals are large—as much as 60 percent larger than their own bodies. The snake’s digestive system is normally dormant, but during digestion metabolic rates can increase fortyfold. A python digesting quietly on the forest floor has the metabolic rate of thoroughbred in a dead heat. This and related foraging processes have broad applications in ecology, cognitive science, anthropology, and conservation biology—and they can be further extrapolated in economics, neurobiology, and computer science.  Foraging is the first comprehensive review of the topic in more than twenty years. A monumental undertaking, this volume brings together twenty-two experts from throughout the field to offer the latest on the mechanics of foraging, modern foraging theory, and foraging ecology. The fourteen essays cover all the relevant issues, including cognition, individual behavior, caching behavior, parental behavior, antipredator behavior, social behavior, population and community ecology, herbivory, and conservation. Considering a wide range of taxa, from birds to mammals to amphibians, Foraging will be the definitive guide to the field.},

One possible explanation for such deviations from optimality is that the ability to sense differences in physical value between available alternatives is constrained by the sensory and cognitive processes for encoding proﬁtability. In this study, we investigated the capacity of a nectarivorous bat species (Glossophaga commissarisi) to discriminate between sugar solutions with different concentrations. We conducted a two-alternative free-choice experiment on a population of wild electronically tagged bats foraging at an array of computer-automated artiﬁcial ﬂowers that recorded individual choices. We used a Bayesian approach to ﬁt individual psychometric functions, relating the strength of preferring the higher concentration option to the intensity of the presented stimulus. Psychometric analysis revealed that discrimination ability increases non-linearly with respect to intensity. We combined this result with a previous psychometric analysis of volume perception. Our theoretical analysis of choice for rewards that vary in two quality dimensions revealed regions of parameter combinations where uneconomic choice is expected. Discrimination ability may be constrained by non-linear perceptual and cognitive encoding processes that result in uneconomical choice.},

	abstract = {The search and orientation behaviours used during foraging depend both on a forager's perceptual and memory abilities and on the spatiotemporal pattern of food distribution. We examined whether nectar-feeding bats using spatially and temporally predictable resources can pinpoint known flower targets within patches from a spatial memory-based approach alone or whether only a coarse-grained spatial memory requires local search for the target's object features within patches. We developed echoacoustically distinct geometric objects as unique acoustic ‘colour markers’ on experimental flowers. We could show that regional scale geometry of the local target environment influences orientation during target approach. Target choice was dependent on the relative positional information of local spatial cues when they were within a 20-cm radius around the target. For a dissociation experiment we first conditioned bats (in the laboratory and the Costa Rica rainforest) to a single target within an array of echoacoustically distinct feeders. During tests feeders were shifted and object cues rearranged. Bats directed initial choices most often at the feeder at the same absolute spatial coordinates as during the learning phase but later choices at the previously rewarded floral object cue. Thus bats had remembered both spatial and object attributes of their food target. However, their search strategy was to rely primarily on spatial memory and only secondarily on cue-based search. Flight approaches to feeders that were guided primarily by spatial memory were of significantly shorter duration than approaches that included active object-cue identification. This indicates a short-term energy advantage of the spatial memory-reliant strategy.},

	abstract = {Cryptic species, defined as those that are morphologically indistinguishable but phylogenetically distinct, are common in bats and correspond to the majority of newly described species. Such seems to be the case of Glossophaga soricina, a generalist, glossophagine bat that is broadly distributed throughout the Neotropics. Several studies have found high levels of molecular variation within G. soricina, suggesting that it could be a cryptic species complex. Here, we explore data derived from two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of cranial characters and their covariation with environmental variables, aiming to test the existence of more than one species grouped within it and to contribute to the knowledge of its variation and evolutionary history. Variation in shape and size of skull and mandible supports the two main mitochondrial lineages reported in previous studies, one corresponding to the east side of the Andes (subspecies G. s. soricina) and the other one corresponding to populations from Mesoamerica and the west side of the Andes, in turn composed of at least three monophyletic and morphologically differentiated taxa. Environmental variables correlate with shape variation and might be responsible for convergences in shape and size between the species with the smallest distributions. Based on the evidence we present in this work we elevate four subspecies to the taxonomic level of species. The correct names for the species of the analyzed complex are: G. soricina (Pallas 1766), G. mutica Merriam 1898, G. antillarum Rehn 1902, and G. valens Miller 1913.},

	abstract = {Experiments in which animals work for food can be classified as involving either an open economy or a closed economy. In a closed economy, an animal's interaction with its environment determines how much food it obtains, whereas in an open economy the intake is determined in part by the experimenter. In this paper these economies are modelled by allowing the animal to allocate its time to various activities including foraging. Maximization of reproductive success involves a trade-off between starvation and predation, and this is used to predict the amount of time devoted to the various activities. The optimal proportion of time spent foraging, u∗, depends on the rate, g, at which food can be obtained. This dependence is investigated and it is shown that in the model of the open economy u∗ increases with g, whereas in the model of the closed economy u∗ decreases with g. The decrease in u∗ during an open economy experiment (‘satiation’) is also explored. The comparison of behaviour in open and closed economies leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the economies as experimental procedures. A general conclusion is that open economies are more suitable for studies of foraging behaviour, and closed economies are more suitable for time allocation studies when activities other than foraging are also important.},

	abstract = {Economics, like behavioral psychology, is a science of behavior, albeit highly organized human behavior. The value of economic concepts for behavioral psychology rests on (1) their empirical validity when tested in the laboratory with individual subjects and (2) their uniqueness when compared to established behavioral concepts. Several fundamental concepts are introduced and illustrated by reference to experimental data: open and closed economies, elastic and inelastic demand, and substitution versus complementarity. Changes in absolute response rate are analyzed in relation to elasticity and intensity of demand. The economic concepts of substitution and complementarity are related to traditional behavioral studies of choice and to the matching relation. The economic approach has many implications for the future of behavioral research and theory. In general, economic concepts are grounded on a dynamic view of reinforcement. The closed-economy methodology extends the generality of behavioral principles to situations in which response rate and obtained rate of reinforcement are interdependent. Analysis of results in terms of elasticity and intensity of demand promises to provide a more direct method for characterizing the effects of “motivational” variables. Future studies of choice should arrange heterogeneous reinforcers with varying elasticities, use closed economies, and modulate scarcity or income. The economic analysis can be extended to the study of performances that involve subtle discriminations or skilled movements that vary in accuracy or quality as opposed to rate or quantity, and thus permit examination of time/accuracy trade-offs.},

	abstract = {Three groups of specialist nectar-feeders covering a continuous size range from insects, birds and bats have evolved the ability for hovering flight. Among birds and bats these groups generally comprise small species, suggesting a relationship between hovering ability and size. In this study we established the scaling relationship of hovering power with body mass for nectar-feeding glossophagine bats (Phyllostomidae). Employing both standard and fast-response respirometry, we determined rates of gas exchange in Hylonycteris underwoodi (7 g) and Choeronycteris mexicana (13–18 g) during hover-feeding flights at an artificial flower that served as a respirometric mask to estimate metabolic power input. The O2 uptake rate (V˙o2) in ml g−1 h−1 (and derived power input) was 27.3 (1.12 W or 160 W kg−1) in 7-g Hylonycteris and 27.3 (2.63 W or 160 W kg−1) in 16.5-g Choeronycteris and thus consistent with measurements in 11.9-g Glossophagasoricina (158 W kg−1, Winter 1998). V˙o2 at the onset of hovering was also used to estimate power during forward flight, because after a transition from level forward to hovering flight gas exchange rates initially still reflect forward flight rates. V˙o2 during short hovering events ({\textless}1.5 s) was 19.0 ml g−1 h−1 (1.8 W) in 16-g Choeronycteris, which was not significantly different from a previous, indirect estimate of the cost of level forward flight (2.1 W, Winter and von Helversen 1998). Our estimates suggest that power input during hovering flight Ph(W) increased with body mass M (kg) within 13–18-g Choeronycteris (n = 4) as Ph = 3544 (±2057 SE) M1.76 (±0.21 SE) and between different glossophagine bat species (n = 3) as Ph = 128 (±2.4 SE) M0.95 (±0.034 SE). The slopes of three scaling functions for flight power (hovering, level forward flight at intermediate speed and submaximal flight power) indicate that: 1. The relationship between flight power to flight speed may change with body mass in the 6–30-g bats from a J- towards a U-shaped curve. 2. A metabolic constraint (hovering flight power equal maximal flight power) may influence the upper size limit of 30–35 g for this group of flower specialists.},

We show that, contrary to what has been implied in the literature, (1) SUT can predict both risk averse and risk prone behaviour for both reward amounts and delays to reward depending on experimental parameters, (2) SUT implies violations of several concepts of rational behaviour (e.g. it violates strong stochastic transitivity and its equivalents, and leads to probability matching) and (3) SUT can predict, but does not always predict, a linear relationship between risk sensitivity in choices and coefficient of variation in the decision-making experiment. SUT derives from Scalar Expectancy Theory which models uncertainty in behavioural timing using a normal distribution. We show that the above conclusions also hold for other distributions, such as the inverse Gaussian distribution derived from drift-diffusion models. A straightforward way to test the key assumptions of SUT is suggested and possible extensions, future prospects and mechanistic underpinnings are discussed.},
