	abstract = {The brms package implements Bayesian multilevel models in R using the probabilistic programming language Stan. A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to ﬁt – among others – linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, response times, ordinal, quantile, zero-inﬂated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user deﬁned covariance structures, censored data, as well as metaanalytic standard errors. Prior speciﬁcations are ﬂexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reﬂect their beliefs. In addition, model ﬁt can easily be assessed and compared using posterior-predictive checks and leave-one-out crossvalidation.

	abstract = {Several characteristics of flowers and fruits have been suggested as comprising syndromes of characters that indicate particular classes of pollinators and fruit dispersers. Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal-Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinatorl disperser classes. Mann-Whitney U-tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose-rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran fruits were sucrose-rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plant-animal interactions be anticipated.},

	abstract = {Recently, it was argued that extrinsic factors, such as high foraging costs, lead to elevated field metabolic rates (FMR). We tested this suggestion by comparing the FMR of nectar-feeding and fruit-eating bats. We hypothesized that the foraging effort per energy reward is higher for nectar-feeding mammals than for fruit-eating mammals, since energy rewards at flowering plants are smaller than those at fruiting plants. Using the doubly labelled water method, we measured the FMR of nectar-feeding Glossophaga commissarisi and fruit-eating Carollia brevicauda, which coexisted in the same rainforest habitat and shared the same daytime roosts. Mass-specific FMR of G. commissarisi exceeded that of C. brevicauda by a factor of almost two: 5.3±0.6 kJ g−1 day−1 for G. commissarisi and 2.8±0.4 kJ g−1 day−1 for C. brevicauda. Since nectar-feeding bats imbibe nectar droplets of only 193 J energy content during each flower visit, a G. commissarisi bat has to perform several 100 flower visits per night to meet its energy requirement. The fruit-eating C. brevicauda, on the other hand, needs to harvest only 3–12 Piper infructescenses per night, as the energy reward per Piper equals ca. 6–30 kJ. We argue that the flowering and fruiting plants exert different selective forces on the foraging behaviour and energetics of pollinators and the seed dispersers, respectively. A comparison between nectar-feeding and non-nectar-feeding species in various vertebrate taxa demonstrates that pollinators have elevated FMRs.},

	abstract = {The relationship between foraging behavior and resource availability for the long—nosed bat (Glossophaga soricina) and five species of plants it fed on in northern Columbia was investigated in a 10—mo study. Glossophaga employed two foraging tactics: (1) territorial defense of concentrated food sources, and (2) trapline foraging along regularly used feeding routes. The tactic used depended on availability of Agave desmettiana nectar and the individual bat's ability to dominate conspecifics. When both hunger and nectar levels were highest, bats concentrated their feeding activity on A. desmettiana. Aggressive behavior was displayed by dominant male and female bats during the first 3—5 h of feeding. Territorial behavior ceased suddenly when nectar levels were depleted by 50\% or more at 2.5—5 h after sunset. Later in the evening, bats foraged briefly from one plant to another at several species along regularly used routes. Bats that maintained early—evening territories had increased access to nectar—rich agave flowers and had significantly smaller total foraging areas than nonterritorial bats. The feeding territories of female Glossophaga were shared with their immature offspring. Territorial behavior at agave was attributed in part to defensibility of its flowers. Foraging experiments demonstrated that G. soricina used a feeding strategy that was efficient with respect to choice of food patch and allocation of time. This is the first study that used marked individuals to document feeding territories and trapline foraging for nectar—feeding bats.},

	abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.

The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.

The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.

	abstract = {Foraging in a variable environment presents a classic problem of decision making with incomplete information. Animals must track the changing environment, remember the best options and make choices accordingly. While several experimental studies have explored the idea that sampling behavior reflects the amount of environmental change, we take the next logical step in asking how change influences memory. We explore the hypothesis that memory length should be tied to the ecological relevance and the value of the information learned, and that environmental change is a key determinant of the value of memory. We use a dynamic programming model to confirm our predictions and then test memory length in a factorial experiment. In our experimental situation we manipulate rates of change in a simple foraging task for blue jays over a 36 hour period. After jays experienced an experimentally determined change regime, we tested them at a range of retention intervals, from 1 to 72 hours. Manipulated rates of change influenced learning and sampling rates: subjects sampled more and learned more quickly in the high change condition. Tests of retention revealed significant interactions between retention interval and the experienced rate of change. We observed a striking and surprising difference between the high and low change treatments at the 24 hour retention interval. In agreement with earlier work we find that a circadian retention interval is special, but we find that the extent of this ‘specialness’ depends on the subject’s prior experience of environmental change. Specifically, experienced rates of change seem to influence how subjects balance recent information against past experience in a way that interacts with the passage of time.},

The pigeons succeeded in tracking the changes in the fluctuating site and the payoff attained was close to the optimum. Variations in the frequency of sampling between experimental treatments were in qualitative agreement with the model for some treatments but not others. The quantitative details of sampling behaviour were not as predicted by the optimality model, but many features could be accounted for by a mechanistic model of choice.

As predicted, the hummingbirds sampled with low frequency when the probability of switch was low, and sampled more frequently ffhen the probability of switch was higher.

For this, we examined the ability of bats to discriminate between two nectar volumes in a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. We used a Bayesian inference approach to determine psychometric functions. From the derived psychometric function we assessed the discrimination threshold at a value of 0.69. G. soricina could clearly distinguish between two volumes, when the difference between the two nectar volumes divided by their average exceeded this value. This indicates that bats possess a sense for the perception and discrimination of volumes of nectar that is better developed than in honeybees.},

For instance, it can explain why we are less likely to detect the removal of three nuts from a bowl if the bowl is full than if it is nearly empty. This is an example of the magnitude effect – the phenomenon that the subjective perception of a linear difference between a pair of stimuli progressively diminishes when the average magnitude of the stimuli increases. Although discrimination performances of both human and animal subjects in various sensory modalities exhibit the magnitude effect, results sometimes systematically deviate from the quantitative predictions based on Weber’s law. An attempt to reformulate the law to better fit data from acoustic discrimination tasks has been dubbed the ‘‘near-miss to Weber’s law’’. Here, we tested the gustatory discrimination performance of nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina), in order to investigate whether the original version of Weber’s law accurately predicts choice behavior in a two-alternative forced choice task. As expected, bats either preferred the sweeter of the two options or showed no preference. In 4 out of 6 bats the near-miss to Weber’s law provided a better fit and Weber’s law underestimated the magnitude effect. In order to test the generality of this observation in nectar-feeders, we reviewed previously published data on bats, hummingbirds, honeybees, and bumblebees. In all groups of animals the near-miss to Weber’s law provided better fits than Weber’s law. Furthermore, whereas the magnitude effect was stronger than predicted by Weber’s law in vertebrates, it was weaker than predicted in insects. Thus nectar-feeding vertebrates and insects seem to differ in how their choice behavior changes as sugar concentration is increased. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of the observed patterns of sugar concentration discrimination.},

            Cryptic species, defined as those that are morphologically indistinguishable but phylogenetically distinct, are common in bats and correspond to the majority of newly described species. Such seems to be the case of Glossophaga soricina, a generalist, glossophagine bat that is broadly distributed throughout the Neotropics. Several studies have found high levels of molecular variation within G. soricina, suggesting that it could be a cryptic species complex. Here, we explore data derived from two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of cranial characters and their covariation with environmental variables, aiming to test the existence of more than one species grouped within it and to contribute to the knowledge of its variation and evolutionary history. Variation in shape and size of skull and mandible supports the two main mitochondrial lineages reported in previous studies, one corresponding to the east side of the Andes (subspecies G. s. soricina) and the other one corresponding to populations from Mesoamerica and the west side of the Andes, in turn composed of at least three monophyletic and morphologically differentiated taxa. Environmental variables correlate with shape variation and might be responsible for convergences in shape and size between the species with the smallest distributions. Based on the evidence we present in this work we elevate four subspecies to the taxonomic level of species. The correct names for the species of the analyzed complex are: G. soricina (Pallas 1766), G. mutica Merriam 1898, G. antillarum Rehn 1902, and G. valens Miller 1913.},

Theory suggests that the value of collecting information, or sampling, depends on environmental persistence and on the relative costs of making wrong decisions. However, empirical tests of how these variables interact are lacking. We tested whether bumblebee foraging decisions are indeed influenced by these two factors. We gave bees repeated choices between a resource providing a steady, mediocre reward and a resource fluctuating between a low reward and a high reward. In this paradigm, we manipulated environmental persistence by changing how long the quality of a fluctuating resource remained stable at one reward level. We manipulated the costs of decision errors by changing the relative values of the available rewards. Bees sampled the fluctuating resource more frequently when it changed quality more frequently, indicating that they measured environmental persistence and reacted to it as predicted by theory. Bees showed surprisingly suboptimal tracking, not reliably choosing the currently best resource except when the fluctuating resource was very persistent and the potential rewards high. While bees modify their choices in response to different levels of change and potential rewards, they do not always do so according to optimality predictions.},

Here, we take the view that “choice behaviour” is a product of agent, environment, and observer, and that “mechanisms of choice” are therefore not to be located solely within the chooser. A simple model, employing the novel methodology of evolving choice behaviour in a multi-agent system, is used to demonstrate that matching behaviour can occur (in stable environments) without any dedicated choice mechanism.},

The model predicts signal following when signal reliability exceeds environmental certainty. We tested this model experimentally using captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata. During each trial, the jays had to choose between two stimuli; one option was correct and led to food, and the other was incorrect and provided no reward. In addition, a third stimulus, the signal, provided information about which choice stimulus was correct. Using this procedure, we manipulated signal reliability (the probability that the signal matched the correct stimulus) and environmental uncertainty (the background probability that a given stimulus was correct) in a factorial experiment. Signal reliability and environmental uncertainty influenced signal use roughly as predicted. Jays used the signal when the signal was reliable and the environment was uncertain, and they ignored the signal when it was unreliable and the environment was predictable. Quantitatively, we observed a bias in favour of environment tracking. Jays sometimes ignored the signal when it could have helped them, and they ignored the signal in conditions where signal following and environment tracking produced equal payoffs.

We asked whether captive blue jays, Cyanocitta cristata, treat leaving and staying in the same way. To do this we factorially varied the delays associated with leaving and staying in a food patch. In addition, we manipulated our subject’s level of motivation (e.g. hunger) using prefeeding treatments. We found that hungry subjects came closest to our prediction of treating leaving and staying in the same way, but that less motivated subjects showed a pronounced and surprising bias in favour of leaving. We discuss the implications of results for experimental and theoretical studies and choice behaviour. We suggest that students of choice behaviour need to understand the sources of such biases because naturally occurring choice situations are seldom perfectly symmetrical.},

Each model employs genetic algorithms to evolve foraging behaviors for multiple agents in spatially explicit environments, structured at the level of situated perception and action.

	abstract = {Observations that humans and other species are sensitive to variability in the outcome of their choices has led to the widespread assumption that this sensitivity reflects adaptations to cope with risk (stochasticity of action consequences). We question this assumption in experiments with starlings. We show that choices between outcomes that are risky in both amount and delay to food are predictable from preferences in the absence of risk. We find that the overarching best predictor of an option's value is the average of the ratios of amount to delay across its (frequency weighted) outcomes, an expression known as “Expectation of the Ratios”, or EoR. Most tests of risk sensitivity focus on the predicted impact of energetic state on preference for risk. We show instead that under controlled state conditions subjects are variance- and risk-neutral with respect to EoR, and this implies variance neutrality for amounts and variance-proneness for delays. The weak risk aversion for amounts often reported requires a small modification of EoR. EoR is consistent with associative learning: acquisition of value for initially neutral stimuli is roughly proportional to the magnitude of their consequences and inversely proportional to the interval between the stimulus and its consequence's onset. If, as is likely, the effect of amount on acquisition is sublinear, the result is a deviation from EoR towards risk aversion for amount. In 3 experiments, we first establish individual birds’ preferences between pairs of fixed options that differ in both amount and delay (small-sooner vs. large-later), and then examine choices between stochastic mixtures that include these options. Experiment 1 uses a titration to establish certainty equivalents, while experiments 2 and 3 measure degree of preference between options with static parameters. The mixtures differ in the coefficient of variation of amount, delay, or both, but EoR is sufficient to predict all results, with no additional explanatory role for riskiness.},

	abstract = {A paper by Caraco, Martindale and Whittam (1980, Animal Behaviour, 28, 820–830) transformed foraging behaviour research by the fundamental realization that actions in nature only rarely have precisely predictable outcomes. They showed that the consequences of risk, understood as the unpredictability and variance of consequences, must play a central role in functional and mechanistic analysis of animal decision processes. Here we examine the article's theoretical and experimental contribution with the benefit of over three decades of hindsight, review developments in the intervening time and discuss the future. Our review confirms previous ones showing that although the earliest results supported the predictions of the original models, a full analysis of the literature does not. In spite of a likely positive publication bias, the majority of studies fail to support a shift from risk proneness when in negative energetic budget to risk aversion when in positive budget, as embodied in the budget rule, and the proportion of failures increases with time. Furthermore, re-examining the earlier experiments we conclude that support should not have been expected, mostly because they implausibly assumed that all probabilities were known to the subjects. We argue that such assumptions should be abandoned, being replaced by realistic, evidence-based models of learning and information processing, such as associative learning and Weber's Law. Our overall message is that models are research tools that can be fecund even if they are transformed and even refuted with the passage of time and the associated accumulation of knowledge.},
